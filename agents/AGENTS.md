# Important Rules

## General
- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Don't add tests for what the type system already guarantees.

## Plan Mode
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
- End every plan with a numbered list of concrete steps. This should be the last thing visible in the terminal.
